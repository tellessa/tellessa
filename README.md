### Hi there 👋

- I’m a full-time software engineer specialized in python and its data ecosystem (pandas, numpy, cv2, among others). I gravitate toward the type of programming that eliminates wasted time through automation, and python has served me well in that regard.
- 🔭 Outside of work, I'm currently working on 2 main projects:
    1. 🎵 AlbumAnalyzer, a web app for analyzing albums using the Spotify API. Technologies involved include GCP, AWS, Docker, Python, Django, a REST API, and JavaScript, CSS, & HTML. I love the intersection of cloud (in particular GCP), Python automation, data visualization, and storytelling. These interests of mine have led me to specialize in data engineering.
    2.👷‍♂️ Data Engineering Zoomcamp with Alexey Grigorev and DataTalksClub.
- 🌱 Aside from my projects where I focus most of my energy, I’m also learning C Programming for Everybody with Dr Chuck Severance.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects involving python and data engineering.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to play 🎹 piano and 🎸guitar.

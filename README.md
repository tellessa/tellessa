### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 2 main projects:
    1. AlbumAnalyzer, a web app for analyzing albums using the Spotify API. Technologies involved include Python, Django, a REST API, and JavaScript, CSS, & HTML. I love the intersection of cloud (in particular GCP), Python automation, data visualization, and storytelling. These interests of mine have led me to specialize in data engineering.
    2. Data Engineering Zoomcamp with Alexey Grigirev and DataTalksClub.
- ðŸŒ± Aside from my projects where I focus most of my energy, Iâ€™m currently learning C Programming for Everybody with Dr Chuck Severance.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects involving python and data engineering.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to play ðŸŽ¹ piano and ðŸŽ¸guitar.

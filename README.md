### Hi there 👋

- I’m a full-time software engineer specialized in python, SQL and their associated toolchains (pandas, numpy, cv2; Postgres, MySQL, Airflow, among others). I gravitate toward the type of programming that eliminates wasted time through automation, and python does a great job at that.
- 🔭 Outside of work, I'm currently working on 🎵 AlbumAnalyzer, a web app for analyzing albums using the Spotify API. Technologies involved include GCP, AWS, Docker, Python, SQL, Django, a REST API, and JavaScript, CSS, & HTML. I love the intersection of cloud (in particular GCP), Python automation, data visualization, and storytelling. These interests of mine have led me to specialize in data engineering.
- 🌱 Aside from my projects where I focus most of my energy, I’m also enjoying going through the 👷‍♂️ Data Engineering Zoomcamp with Alexey Grigorev and DataTalksClub and learning C Programming for Everybody with Dr Chuck Severance.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects involving python and data engineering.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to play 🎹 piano and 🎸guitar, and I love how some of the math involved in making music crosses over to programming.
